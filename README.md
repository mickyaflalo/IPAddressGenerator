# IPAddressGenerator
Are you sick and tired of having to find a way to generate IP Adress Ranges, especially if you are doing an OpenVAS Scan? Well you're in luck! With the IP Address Generator all you have to do is input a IP address range and the program will output the results to a text file separated by new lines.







Example Input: 10.0.2.1-255
Example Input: 192,210.168.1.1-100
Example Input: 10-15.8,10,22,34.6-15.2-200
I've included the source code and a compiled JAR file. 
Feel free to reach out to me and let me know how it is! 
Thanks! :)
